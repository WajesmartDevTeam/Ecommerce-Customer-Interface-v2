            Calculation of discount
          </h3>
          <div class="terms-content">
            <p>
              Where an online offer states that a percentage discount will be given on a purchase, the cost of the qualifying purchases will be reduced by the stated discount percentage.
              Where purchases are stated to be offered on a "VAT-free" basis, the prices of qualifying items will be reduced by the equivalent of VAT. At the current VAT rate of 5% this equates to a discount of 4.76%.
              Supplementary charges such as delivery or postage & packing shall not be discounted unless specifically stated in the offer description.
